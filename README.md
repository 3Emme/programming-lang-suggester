# __Programming Language Suggester__

#### __An application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first, August 14, 2020__

#### By _**Emme Buentiempo**_

## Description

This application was created as an Epicodus assignment, with the intent to have it serve as a demonstration of knowledge after the program's second week. For the time being this README will serve as a checklist to demonstrate the satisfaction of all project requirements and objectives.

## Project requirements:

  * Create an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Keep in mind that even though all languages have similarities and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still put some thought into which language they should learn. **[Complete]**
  * Choose at least three languages that prospective learners should consider. Here are some possibilities:
    * Ruby **[Complete]**
    * C# **[Complete]**
    * JavaScript **[Complete]**
    * Go
    * Python
    * Rust
    * Swift
  * Feel free to pick any language that interests you, either from this list or from your own research.
  * Then create a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant. Note that you are not required to research the languages extensively and you can even choose silly or irrelevant questions to determine which language would be best - for instance, people that like singing in the rain may prefer Ruby while chihuahua lovers might prefer C#. **[Complete]**
    * Include a minimum of 5 survey questions. **[Complete]**
    * Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions. **[Complete]**
    * Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone. **[Complete]**
  * Note: You are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages. It is also not required to publish your project to GitHub pages, but you may do so if you wish. **[Complete]**

## Project Objectives:

  * All previous standards (last week's objectives) are in place (see below). **[Complete]**
  * Site uses branching to return the result. **[Complete]**
  * jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.) **[Complete]**
  * Form gathers input from the user. **[Complete]**
  * Variable names are descriptive of what they represent. **[Complete]**
  * Web page is styled using custom CSS. **[Complete]**
  * The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state. **[Complete]**
  * Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline. **[Complete]**
  * Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology. **[Complete]**

  # _Previous Objectives:_

For reference, here are last week's objectives:

  * Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools. **[Complete]**
  * Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦". **[Complete]**
  * Project README that includes, bare minimum:
    * author name **[Complete]**
    * program name **[Complete]**
    * detailed setup instructions **[Complete]**
    * description **[Complete]**
    * copyright and license information **[Complete]**

## Setup/Installation Requirements

There are many ways to setup/install this; here's one thats relatively accessible and free:
* _Fork this repository on Github, then clone it_
* _Create a new branch called gh-pages_
  * _you can do so with the following terminal command while in the project directory:_
  >$ git branch gh-pages
* _Push the new branch to Github_
  * _you can do so with the following terminal command while in the project directory:_
  >$ git checkout gh-pages
  >
  >$ git push origin gh-pages
* _Now the site should be available for viewing at your-github-username.github.io/portfolio._
  * _(your-github-username is just a placeholder, please replace it with your github username)_
